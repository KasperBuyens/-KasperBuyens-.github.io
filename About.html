            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I am Kasper Buyens, student applied computer science at Hogent. I was born and raised in Ronse, Belgium.
                    My main interests, aside from IT related stuff, are history and games, so my hobbies are gaming, reading, LEGO collecting and I used to fence. 
                    Unfortunately I had to give up this sport due to lack of free time.
                    <br/> Some of my most important personal traits are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eye for details</li>
                        <li>Motivated when I am trully interested in the matter</li>
                        <li>Perseverance</li>
                        <li>Creative</li>
                        <li>Organised</li>
                        <li>Loyal</li>
                    </ul>
                </p> 
            <br/>
            <h2>What do I want?</h2>
            <p>
                I want to work for a company where I can be my true self, where I feel at home, and I want to do a job that I love.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I am currently still a student, in my second year of my bachelor in applied computer science.
                    I chose this major, because I wanted to know how computers worked, and earlier initiations learned me that I enjoy programming.
                    I'm quite good at math, so this seemed like the right choice fore me! I decided to specialise in programming, because programming is what got me interested in IT in the first place.
